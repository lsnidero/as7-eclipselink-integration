This library is a collection of utility classes to aid the integration
of EclipseLink into JBossAS7. It bundles the code from:

  https://community.jboss.org/wiki/HowToUseEclipseLinkWithAS7

into a small JBoss AS 7 module that, when installed and turned on with
appropriate system properties activates to handle integration between AS7 and
EclipseLink.

ISSUES RESOLVED BY THE INTEGRATION
----------------------------------

- EclipseLink doesn't find entity classes unless they're explicitly listed in
  persistence.xml
  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=383200
  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-5062
  
- JNDI location for JBoss Transaction Manager is wrong
  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=365704
  (Workaround only activated on EclipseLink 2.3.2 and below,
  newer EclipseLink versions include the fix).

- EclipseLink doesn't integrate into JBoss's logging, producing verbose and
  poorly formatted logs on stderr and not respecting log filtering levels.

ISSUES NOT RESOLVED BY THE INTEGRATION
--------------------------------------

- Static metamodel isn't populated before user code can access it on JBoss AS
  7.1.1.Final
  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=383199

Any known issues with EclipseLink + AS7 should be listed on the
JBoss community link above, and on the EclipseLink bugzilla
tracking bug for AS7 integration:

TO BUILD
--------

To build this module, run:

  mvn -DskipTests=true clean install

Why skip tests? See TESTING below.


TO INSTALL ECLIPSELINK AND THE INTEGRATION INTO JBOSS AS 7
----------------------------------------------------------

The build produces a pair of read-to-install JBoss AS 7 modules for EclipseLink
and the integration module in target/as7module. You can install them with:

  cp -r target/as7module/* $JBOSS_HOME/modules/

Note that you're installing two modules:

  org.eclipse.persistence
  id.au.ringerc.eclipselinkintegration

The latter has a META-INF/services entry that *should* cause JBoss AS 7 to
activate it when an EclipseLink persistence provider is detected, but this
isn't working for as yet unknown reasons. You must set system properties
to enable the module:

$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect

  /system-property=eclipselink.target-server:add(value=JBoss)
  /system-property=eclipselink.logging.logger:add(value=id.au.ringerc.as7.eclipselinkintegration.JBossLogger)
  /system-property=eclipselink.archive.factory:add(value=id.au.ringerc.as7.eclipselinkintegration.JBossArchiveFactoryImpl)

The first two may be set as persistence.xml properties instead. The last must
be a system property to be recognised by EclipseLink.

DIFFERENT VERSIONS
------------------

If you want to package a different EclipseLink version, either rebuild with 
the eclipselink version specified as a build property (recommended, see below)
or replace the EclipseLink jar in the module and modify module.xml to point
to the new jar name.

If you want a different version of EclipseLink to be included in the created
module, you can specify it with the eclipselink.version Maven property, eg;

  mvn -Declipselink.version=2.3.3-M3 clean install

If you're using EclipseLink 2.3.2 or older you must also change the
eclipselink.target-server system property to:

  /system-property=eclipselink.target-server:add(value=id.au.ringerc.as7.eclipselinkintegration.JBossAS7ServerPlatform)

CONTROLLING LOG LEVELS
----------------------

You may optionally increase log detail for EclipseLink in AS7:

  jboss-cli.sh --connect '/subsystem=logging/logger=org.eclipse.persistence:add(level=TRACE)'

and/or in the integration module:

  jboss-cli.sh --connect '/subsystem=logging/logger=id.au.ringerc.as7.eclipselinkpersistence:add(level=TRACE)'

TESTING
-------

Why have tests then skip them?

The tests are Arquillian integration tests that require JBoss AS 7 to be
running locally on default ports unless overridden, and require the module to
be installed on the AS7 server. We don't want a build just going ahead and
installing a module on your AS7 server, so the tests don't do that
automatically, and will fail if run without that installation being performed.
Proper integration tests require it to be possible to bundle EclipseLink with
the test deployment, and that seems to be impossible right now:

  https://community.jboss.org/thread/201605

so you have to install the modules then re-test.
